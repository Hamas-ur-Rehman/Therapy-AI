Dr. Balis:    Hello
Ms. Evans:    Hi
Dr. Balis:    Good morning Ms. Evans. Please have a seat.	
Ms. Evans:    I'm so sorry I'm late. Everything seemed pitted against my getting here on time. Oh, God, twenty-five minutes late. I am sorry.	
Dr. Balis:    I do understand. I'm sure you will try to be on time in the future.	
Ms. Evans:    Yes, Doctor, I will. Thank you. Please, call me Cassie. Everyone does.	
Dr. Balis:    Very well, Cassie, if it makes you more comfortable. I see from your form that you have never been to a therapist before. If you have any questions feel free to ask them at anytime, okay? Now, what brings you into the office today?	
Ms. Evans:    Well, I am not sure really. I had heard that SII signed up a new doctor, and I guess there have been some things on my mind lately. Maybe I shouldn't even be here.	
Dr. Balis:    Okay. Why don't we start by discussing what has been on your mind?	
Ms. Evans:    Well, I am very frustrated lately. You see, I work as an executive assistant at SII, but it's really just a means to make money while I pursue my real goal--to be an actress. I have been taking classes since I was, like, 8 or 9 years old. Hollywood has always fascinated me. Can you imagine living in those times? The golden age of the cinema. Fred and Ginger waltzing across the big screen, Vivien Leigh and 'Gone With The Wind', Casablanca.	
Dr. Balis:    What is it about acting and those films that intrigue you?	
Ms. Evans:    Well, I guess the style, the romance, the way anything could and did happen. And dreams came true in this grand way. They were larger than life.	
Dr. Balis:    So tell me, what are you doing to pursue your dream of being an actress?	
Ms. Evans:    I guess I haven't been doing everything I should. I mean, I don't have an agent. I started going to these acting classes--actually, it's this acting improvisational troupe. I really like going there, but it's so hard on me.	
Dr. Balis:    Why?	
Ms. Evans:    Well to start off, my boyfriend is not very happy with me and the acting thing. He thinks it's ridiculous because it is so hard to make a living at it. And in the meantime, I could be building a "real" career. He wants to get more serious with me, but wants to make sure that I can be a productive bread winner. And I think he is jealous.	
Dr. Balis:    Jealous? How so?	
Ms. Evans:    Well, for one thing, I think it's because I am very busy, so we have less time together. Plus there are men in the group, and sometimes we have to do love scenes. I've told him its just acting, pretending, and its part of my "job." But he gets furious. He won't even discuss it anymore.	
Dr. Balis:    How is your relationship with him besides the acting?	
Ms. Evans:    Well...good, I guess. We met in college, and have been dating ever since then. I do really like him, maybe even love him, but...he can be kind of demanding at times.	
Dr. Balis:    How do you mean, demanding?	
Ms. Evans:    Well, we always do what he wants to do. Except romantically.	
Dr. Balis:    What happens romantically?	
Ms. Evans:    I don't know if I can discuss this. I mean, I am a little embarrassed and uncomfortable.	
Dr. Balis:    I understand. This is only our first session and it's normal to take some time to develop a level of trust between us. Hopefully we'll be able to explore troubling areas more deeply as time progresses. In the meantime, I think it would help you to keep a journal. A place that you can fully express yourself, whenever you feel like it. How does that sound?	
Ms. Evans:    I already keep a journal. It's something I learned to do in acting classes, explore the unconscious and stuff.	
Dr. Balis:    Good. I think this will help you with other aspects of life as well.	
Ms. Evans:    Do I have to bring it with me every week?	
Dr. Balis:    That is up to you. The journal is a tool to assist you in monitoring your feelings. What bothers you, what makes you happy, and so forth. Then, at a later time, you can go back and reflect on what transpired, or remind yourself how you handled a situation and how you can best handle it if the problem resurfaces. If you would like to bring it in to discuss or as a basis for discussion, then by all means, do so. I also like to read them because they give me some insight into who you are. But if you feel uncomfortable about my reading your journal, that's perfectly okay too. Even if the journal is just for you to read, I'm sure you'll find it valuable.	
Ms. Evans:    Okay.	
Dr. Balis:    Good. I'm afraid our session is a bit abbreviated this time. So I'll see you in a week. Let's see, that's July 30th at 1 o'clock. Okay?	
Ms. Evans:    Okay. Thank you Doctor
Ms. Evans:    Hi, Doctor. I'm on time for this visit.	
Dr. Balis:    Yes, I noticed; even a little early. Do you tend to have trouble keeping appointments?	
Ms. Evans:    No. I tend to be an early bird of sorts. I mean, I like to be prepared for things. I guess I am a little neurotic that way. Sorry I was late last time. I was just...I guess, nervous about coming here.	
Dr. Balis:    As I said last time, hopefully you will become more comfortable with the therapy process as time goes on. Of course, therapy is very personal. It may be that I am not the right person for you to be talking to.	
Ms. Evans:    I think it was just my own preconceptions of what therapy is, like I am a loony or something.	
Dr. Balis:    You seem a little more at ease, though, and that's good. Why don't you tell me how your week was?	
Ms. Evans:    It was okay, I suppose. Just same old, same old. I am a little more frustrated with the people at SII. They treat me like such a flake sometimes. And it is just so unfair! I work just as hard as the next guy. I have a college diploma that I worked hard for. Just because I'm pursuing an acting career, doesn't mean I didn't study other things. I have a freakin' minor in business technology operations, for heaven's sakes! I know more about what's going on in there than most of them do. Just 'cause I am a pretty face doesn't mean I don't have a brain, too.	
Dr. Balis:    What is it that they do that upsets you?	
Ms. Evans:    They piss me off! I am so fed up with everyone's crap! My family is giving me shit on the "not settling into a respectable career" line, Brian is bitching out of both sides of his mouth, my employers don't give me the respect I deserve. What the heck does everyone want from me? Sheesh!	
Dr. Balis:    Why don't you take a deep breath, and we can work one at a time on these pressures and annoyances, okay?	
Ms. Evans:    Yes. I suppose you are right.	
Dr. Balis:    Okay, let's tackle one problem at a time. Have you spoken to anyone at work regarding your treatment there?	
Ms. Evans:    No. I don't know what to say, who to say it to, even. They are my superiors, so they can do whatever they want, and I just have to take it.	
Dr. Balis:    Don't you think it would be perfectly acceptable for you to air you feelings? Perhaps they don't realize how valuable you are to the company, or don't realize they are upsetting you.	
Ms. Evans:    I guess I could talk to my immediate supervisor, see what she says. I am not just a glorified secretary, I really do much more there.	
Dr. Balis:    I am sure. And that is the type of thing you should discuss with your supervisor.	
Ms. Evans:    I guess so.	
Dr. Balis:    You seem reluctant.	
Ms. Evans:    I need the job. I need it to survive, make rent, pay for the groceries. I don't have the time or energy to go out and find another job. And I don't think I could handle the waitressing deal. I'd be too exhausted to pursue my acting, and perform in Winging It.	
Dr. Balis:    Well, ultimately it's your decision. Perhaps in your journal...you are still keeping one, yes? Perhaps you can make a list of pros and cons for making such a move. For instance, not saying anything means you must learn to cope with how you are treated there. Saying something may put your job in some jeopardy. Do you see what I am getting at here?	
Ms. Evans:    Yes, it's a good idea.	
Dr. Balis:    You can bring in the listing if you would like. We can even do a role play exercise if you'd like.	
Ms. Evans:    You know, I never thought of it that way. I can create a character and use it as a shield. Of course, that can backfire, but it would take the pressure off of me, either way. I don't know. I think I will start with a list of pro and cons.	
Dr. Balis:    Okay. Now, about Brian. You mentioned last time that he can be demanding, and tends to get his way. Would you care to elaborate?	
Ms. Evans:    Brian was my first real boyfriend. He was pretty supportive of me during college. Things seemed simpler back then. He now works for an accounting company. I don't know, it almost seems as if he lost his imagination and creativity. He is so into preparing for the future, buying into the corporate image.	
Dr. Balis:    Has this affected your relationship, do you think?	
Ms. Evans:    I don't know. In acting classes, I once played a woman who went for 'father-image' type of boyfriends. I thought to myself, I never want to be like that. I think people should be together because they truly love each other and enjoy their company. And even though I would go to Brian for advice during school, I didn't think I was dependent on him or anything. And I made my own decisions. Now he gets all pissy when I don't do what he wants. And to avoid any arguments and stuff, I tend to just go along with what he wants. I mean, if it means we don't have to fight, what difference does it make if we have Chinese instead of Italian for dinner?	
Dr. Balis:    Do you feel you are losing any integrity at all when you go along with his wishes?	
Ms. Evans:    Hmm. I don't think I ever thought about it that way. I really don't think it has anything to do about my integrity, actually. Like, he wants to advance our physical relationship, and I won't let him.	
Dr. Balis:    You did mention last time that he can be demanding romantically.	
Ms. Evans:    Okay, I guess I might as well tell you. I mean, this is all confidential and stuff. I read up on doctor-patient relationships.	
Dr. Balis:    Of course. What you tell me is between you and I only.	
Ms. Evans:    Well, I am a virgin. Nothing to be ashamed of, right? I don't think I can commit to him my entire body and soul if he can't commit to me entirely. A couple of months ago, he got kind of aggressive when we were making out. Made me very uncomfortable. Then carried on when I pulled away. He said I was abnormal. Okay, I admit, it may be rare for someone 24 to still be a virgin, but that doesn't mean I am abnormal. He said that he couldn't understand how I can make out "hot and heavy" on stage with people I hardly know, but won't get more intimate with him. Like I owe him something. And the thing is, had he not made such a big deal, and let me warm up to the idea, I probably would have given in. I mean, I am very curious. About sex. This girl in my class, Erica, she said she was up for a role in a big movie, it was for a prostitute. So she slept with some guy to see what is was like and to get into character. I don't think I would go that far, but to be a good actress, I do need to experience things. But I wouldn't do it just to do it, like Erica did.	
Dr. Balis:    How do you really feel about Brian? Are you physically attracted to him?	
Ms. Evans:    Do you mean do I think he's sexy? I guess so. I mean...he is very attractive. I don't know. I think maybe I am not very happy with him recently. I guess that affects my physical feelings towards him. What do you think, doctor?	
Dr. Balis:    It can and probably does affect how you feel about him. Besides Brian, have you dated much?	
Ms. Evans:    I dated very casually in high school, then met Brian almost right away in college. Since then, I have pretty much been with him.	
Dr. Balis:    And he with you?	
Ms. Evans:    Yes, I think so. Why would you ask?	
Dr. Balis:    Has he been faithful during the entire time?	
Ms. Evans:    He better have been! I'd chop his nuts off if I found out he was sleeping around while trying to get me into bed!	
Dr. Balis:    Do you really think you would react so violently?	
Ms. Evans:    No, I'd probably just cry for days.	
Dr. Balis:    Getting back to your feelings toward Brian, do you see yourself having sex with him in the future?	
Ms. Evans:    I'm not sure I can answer that.	
Dr. Balis:    Do you have sexual fantasies?	
Ms. Evans:    I really don't think I can discuss this right now. I think I would prefer writing it down then talking about it face to face. You know, it isn't prudishness actually. To be quite frank, I could talk with you explicitly about sex and doing it--make you blush, probably. But I'd be doing it as a character and not really me. Is there some way we can do this in writing?	
Dr. Balis:    Hmmm. I am glad you acknowledge that inherent risk of hiding behind the theatrical mask. Well, why don't you try to write something and leave it for me here at my office before our next session. Then I can have a look at it and we can take it from there. Does that work for you?	
Ms. Evans:    I think that's an excellent idea.	
Dr. Balis:    Our time is almost up. I've scheduled an appointment for you next week at this time. Let's see, that's August 6th at 1 pm. And if you need to talk to me before that time, always feel free to give me a call.	
Ms. Evans:    Thank you, doctor. And thank you for being understanding and patient with me.	
Dr. Balis:    Of course, Cassie. And I want you to think about ways to improve the situation at work, okay?	
Ms. Evans:    Yes. Goodbye.	
Dr. Balis:    Goodbye.
