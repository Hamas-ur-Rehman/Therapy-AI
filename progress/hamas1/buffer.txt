Thank you for asking, Hamas. As a wellness coach and an expert in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I can help you identify the negative patterns of thought and behavior that are contributing to your depression, and work with you to develop more positive and helpful ways of thinking and behaving. We can start by exploring your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in more detail during the assessment phase, and then move on to the intervention phase where we will work on developing practical strategies to manage your depression. Would you like to start the assessment phase now?
